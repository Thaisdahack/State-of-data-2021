## Conclusions

The first approach in data analysis was the difference in the total number of respondents based on gender, mostly men responded to the questionnaire, which may have influenced the other parameters analyzed that differ between men and women.
As for the area of ​​activity, the data analyst is the one that appears most frequently, both for men and women. The area of ​​data science and data engineering is also relevant, but it is worth mentioning that acting as a manager or other leadership positions is more frequent among men when compared to women.
The responsibilities that occupy most of the employees' time are:

- Processing and data analysis using languages such as Python and R;
- Develop and maintain ETL's; among other functions.
- Expertise in data modeling;

That said, the most cited programming languages among respondents were primarily Python and SQL.
Regarding salary parameters, the discrepancy between genders is evident. Comparing the salary range between the positions held, in the area of ​​Data Analyst and BI Analyst, most people earn an average of 4 thousand reais to 6 thousand reais. The business analyst, on the other hand, earns between 8,000 and 16,000 reais and finally the data engineer, initially has a salary of 4,000 reais and can reach 16,000 per month. When compared to the time of experience, clearly the more experience the higher the salary, but it is interesting to note that even with little experience the average salary is around 4 thousand reais per month.
Finally, with regard to employability in the data area, it was possible to observe that more than 50% of people had less than 1 year of experience before getting their first job and the vast majority of respondents are employed in a clt regime. There is also a great diversity in the area of training of the interviewees, but with the prevalence in the area of exact sciences, another interesting point is that most interviewees have a degree, but no specialization in the area and even many of the interviewees do not have training in University education.
