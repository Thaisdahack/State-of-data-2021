## Conclusions

The first approach in data analysis was the difference in the total number of respondents based on gender, mostly men answered the questionnaire, which may have influenced the other parameters analyzed that distinguish between genders.
As for the area of ​​activity, the 'data analyst is the one that appears most frequently, both for men and women.
The area of ​​data science and data engineering is also relevant in the data set, however, it is worth mentioning that acting as a manager is more frequent among men than women.
The responsibilities that occupy most of the employees' time are:
- Processing and analyzing data using languages ​​such as Python and R;
- Developing and taking care of the maintenance of ETL's; among other functions.
- Acting in data modeling;
That said, the most cited programming language among respondents were mostly Python and SQL.
Regarding salary parameters, the discrepancy between genders is evident.
Comparing the salary range between the positions held, in the area of ​​Data Analyst and BI Analyst, most people earn on average between 4 thousand reais and 6 thousand reais. The business analyst, on the other hand, earns between 8,000 and 16,000 reais per month and finally the data engineer, initially has a salary of 4,000 reais and can reach 16,000 per month.
When compared with time of experience, clearly the more experience the better the salary, however it is interesting to note that even with little experience the average salary is around 4 thousand reais per month.
Finally, in an approach that concerns employability in the data area, it was possible to observe that more than 50% of people had less than 1 year of experience before starting to work and the vast majority of survey respondents are employed under the clt regime. .
A great diversity is also observed in the area of ​​training of the respondents, but with a prevalence of the exact area, another interesting point is that most of the interviewees have a degree but no specialization in the area.
